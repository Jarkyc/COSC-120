1) ask user input a positive integer to represent temperature (assume the temperature > 0) at Salisbury from keyboard; if the input is not valid, ask user input again till the input is valid;


based on the input temperature, output the corresponding word(s) using the following rules:
- temperature >  90: Hot
- 60 <  temperature  <= 90: Pleasant
- 40 <= temperature <= 60: Cold
- temperature < 40: Very cold

//Charles Reigle
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int temp;

	cout << "Please input a temperature greater than 0" << endl;
	cin >> temp;

	while (temp < 0) {
		cout << "Invalid input. Please try again" << endl;
		cin >> temp;
	}

	string resp;

	if (temp > 90) resp = "Hot";
	else if (temp > 60 && temp <= 90) resp = "Pleasant";
	else if (temp >= 40 && temp <= 60) resp = "Cold";
	else resp = "Very Cold";
	
	cout << "The temperature outside is " << resp << endl;


}


2. Input a positive integer n, use a for/while/do-while loop to calculate and output the sum of all the even numbers between 1 and n.

// Input a positive integer n, use a for/while/do-while loop to calculate and output the sum of all the even numbers between 1 and n.

//Charles Reigle

#include <iostream>;
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int n;

	cout << "Input a postive number: " << endl;
	cin >> n;

	while (n < 0) {
		cout << "Invalid input, number must be positive. Try again." << endl;
		cin >> n;
	}

	int sum = 0;
	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
		if (i % 2 == 0) {
			sum += i;
		}
	}

	cout << "The sum of all even numbers between 1 and " << n << " is " << sum << endl;
}

3. Use a for/while loop to print out the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 64. 

//Use a for/while loop to print out the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 64. 

//Charles Reigle

#include <iostream>;
using namespace std;

int main() {
	for (int i = 1; i <= 64; i *= 2) {
		cout << i << " ";
	}
}
